# Sprint-Metrics
A web application that I made to learn react and node js. To run it do "npm install" from the root package to download the dependencies. Few of the dependencies you might have to install separately. To start the frontend server, do "npm start" in the same path that contains package.json file. For backend server, go to src and do "node server.js". 

The purpose was to initially build a capacity estimation tool for members involved in a sprint iteration i.e for members of a scrum team. The Capacity Estimator can be used to fill days and time for a particular sprint member, currently limited to Testing/Development and save the data in a json file with that sprint name. Overtime this data is plotted used plotly.js library. 

It is a simple and good project for starters to clone and explore react states, api calls from front-end, React-Router, simple plotting library and react-bootstrap. Also two api's namely for reading and saving data are written using express server.
